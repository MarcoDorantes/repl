# repl
[nRepl](https://www.nuget.org/packages/nRepl/) is a .NET Standard class library with basic support for Read-Evaluate-Print-Loops (REPL). That is, at this time, it provides a class method with a loop to play and to operate, interactively, a given set of input classes and input instances.

nRepl is built on top of [nSwitch](https://www.nuget.org/packages/nSwitch/) to provide a REPL loop over any input class or input instance operable with [nSwitch](https://www.nuget.org/packages/nSwitch/).

## What is an input class?

## What is an input instance?

## Simple use cases
